# üõ†Ô∏è GOODS RECEIPT ENHANCEMENTS - FIXED GST, QUANTITIES & DISCOUNTS

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Discount Support Added** ‚≠ê NEW FEATURE
- Added **Discount%** column to goods receipt
- Discounts are applied to trade price before calculating retail price
- Right-click on Discount% column to edit discount percentage (0-100%)
- Discounts properly affect cost calculations with FOC items

### 2. **GST Calculations Fixed** üîß
- **Corrected GST formula:**
  - **Exclusive GST:** Retail = Discounted Trade √ó (1 + GST%)
  - **Inclusive GST:** Retail = Discounted Trade (GST already included)
- GST now applies to **discounted trade price** (not original trade price)
- Right-click GST% column to edit GST rate
- Auto-calculates GST when you edit retail price

### 3. **Quantity Management Improved** üì¶
- **Received Qty:** Quantity purchased (paid for)
- **FOC Qty:** Free of charge quantity (bonus items)
- **Cost Price Calculation:** 
  ```
  Cost Price = (Received Qty √ó Discounted Trade Price) / (Received Qty + FOC Qty)
  ```
- FOC items reduce average cost but don't increase purchase cost
- Total stock = Received + FOC

### 4. **Column Layout Improved** üìä
New column order makes more sense:
1. Product
2. PO Qty
3. Received
4. FOC
5. Trade Price (editable)
6. **Discount%** (editable - NEW!)
7. GST% (editable)
8. Retail Price (editable)
9. UOM
10. Cost Price (auto-calculated)

## üìê Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Simple Purchase (No Discount, No FOC)
```
Trade Price: Rs. 100
Discount: 0%
GST: 17% (exclusive)
Received: 10 units
FOC: 0 units

Calculations:
- Discounted Trade = 100 √ó (1 - 0/100) = Rs. 100
- Retail Price = 100 √ó (1 + 17/100) = Rs. 117
- Cost Price = (10 √ó 100) / 10 = Rs. 100
- Total Stock Added = 10 units
```

### Example 2: With Discount (No FOC)
```
Trade Price: Rs. 100
Discount: 10%
GST: 17% (exclusive)
Received: 10 units
FOC: 0 units

Calculations:
- Discounted Trade = 100 √ó (1 - 10/100) = Rs. 90
- Retail Price = 90 √ó (1 + 17/100) = Rs. 105.30
- Cost Price = (10 √ó 90) / 10 = Rs. 90
- Total Stock Added = 10 units
```

### Example 3: With FOC (No Discount)
```
Trade Price: Rs. 100
Discount: 0%
GST: 17% (exclusive)
Received: 10 units
FOC: 2 units (bonus)

Calculations:
- Discounted Trade = 100 √ó (1 - 0/100) = Rs. 100
- Retail Price = 100 √ó (1 + 17/100) = Rs. 117
- Cost Price = (10 √ó 100) / (10 + 2) = Rs. 83.33
- Total Stock Added = 12 units (10 paid + 2 free)
```

### Example 4: Complete Scenario (Discount + FOC)
```
Trade Price: Rs. 100
Discount: 10%
GST: 17% (exclusive)
Received: 10 units
FOC: 2 units (bonus)

Calculations:
- Discounted Trade = 100 √ó (1 - 10/100) = Rs. 90
- Retail Price = 90 √ó (1 + 17/100) = Rs. 105.30
- Cost Price = (10 √ó 90) / (10 + 2) = Rs. 75
- Total Stock Added = 12 units
- Total Purchase Cost = Rs. 900 (only for 10 units, FOC is free)
```

### Example 5: Inclusive GST
```
Trade Price: Rs. 117 (GST included)
Discount: 0%
GST: 17% (inclusive)
Received: 10 units
FOC: 0 units

Calculations:
- Discounted Trade = 117 √ó (1 - 0/100) = Rs. 117
- Retail Price = Rs. 117 (GST already included)
- Cost Price = (10 √ó 117) / 10 = Rs. 117
- Total Stock Added = 10 units
```
