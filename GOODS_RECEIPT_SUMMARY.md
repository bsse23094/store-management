# 🎉 GOODS RECEIPT SYSTEM - FULLY ENHANCED

## ✅ WHAT'S BEEN FIXED

Your goods receipt system now has **professional-grade** calculations with:

### 1. ✨ **Discount Support** (NEW!)
- Added **Discount%** column
- Supports 0% to 100% discount
- Applied to trade price before GST
- Right-click to edit

### 2. 🔧 **Fixed GST Calculations**
- GST now applies to **discounted** price (not original)
- Supports **Exclusive** GST (added on top)
- Supports **Inclusive** GST (already in price)

### 3. 📦 **Improved Quantity & Cost Logic**
- **Received Qty:** Items you paid for
- **FOC Qty:** Free bonus items
- **Cost Price:** Spreads paid cost over all items (including FOC)
- **Formula:** Cost = (Received × Discounted Price) / (Received + FOC)

### 4. 💰 **Better Column Layout**
New 10-column design (was 9):
1. Product
2. PO Qty
3. Received ✏️
4. FOC ✏️
5. Trade Price 🖱️
6. **Discount%** 🖱️ ⭐ NEW
7. GST% 🖱️

## 📊 HOW IT WORKS

### The Calculation Flow:
```
Step 1: Trade Price - Discount = Discounted Trade Price
Step 2: Discounted Trade + GST = Retail Price
Step 3: (Received × Discounted) / (Received + FOC) = Cost Price
```

### Example Scenario:
```
Trade Price:    Rs. 100
Discount:       10%
GST:            17% (exclusive)
Received:       10 units
FOC:            2 units

Result:
- Discounted Trade = Rs. 90
- Retail Price = Rs. 105.30
- Cost Price = Rs. 75.00
- Total Stock = 12 units
- Profit per unit = Rs. 30.30 (40.4% margin!)
```

4. **System Auto-Calculates:**

5. **Save Receipt** - Stock and prices update automatically!
